Whether you are a beginner or an experienced maker, here you will find resources to help you create, experiment, and bring your electronics projects to life. What is Arduino? Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It allows you to: Control LEDs, motors, sensors, and other devices Build interactive projects Learn the fundamentals of electronics and programming Arduino boards can read inputs from a sensor, process the data, and control outputs like motors or lights. They are widely used in robotics, home automation, and DIY electronics. Getting Started Choose a Board : Common boards include Arduino Uno, Nano, and Mega. Install the IDE : Download the Arduino IDE to write and upload code. Connect Your Board : Use a USB cable to connect your Arduino to your computer. Write Your First Sketch : Start simple with a \u201cBlink\u201d program to make an LED blink. Explore Projects Check out the different sections in this site to explore: Basic Projects : Learn fundamental electronics and programming. Intermediate Projects : Combine sensors, motors, and logic. Advanced Projects : Automate tasks, build robots, and experiment with IoT.
